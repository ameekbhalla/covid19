This project tests if the sex of a head of state/government had an effect on its COVID-19 outcomes.
Background: A female [twitter user responded](https://twitter.com/eawilloughby/status/1249852024067416064) to a [Forbes article that went viral claiming that countries with woemn leaders had better COVID-19 outcomes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2020/04/13/what-do-countries-with-the-best-coronavirus-reponses-have-in-common-women-leaders/). She concluded that there was no effect of the sex of a counties leader on its COVID-19 outcomes.

I was concerned that the conclusion of "no effect" might be hasty because the twitter user made two mistakes:
1. She applied the incorrect statistical test (count data should be tested with a Poisson distribution not a t-test) 
2. She also drastically truncated the data (see the discrepancy between her t-tests' degrees of freedom, t(df), and the N's)
Therefore, I tested the full data set (N = 213) with a Poisson distribution (using a generalized linear model).

Lastly, simple numbers of cases & deaths are incomparable between countries because the onset of the pandemic happened on different dates. (The twitter user above should have simply compared case fatality rates.) To compare cases and deaths across countries don't compare curves of per capita rates, but curves of per capita rates starting at the same reference point [(example, the day since each country had 1death/million people)](https://twitter.com/jonfwilkins/status/1249511124749422593).
